Welcome to my page! 
<br>

I'm a Master's student in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am working with [Prof. Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 2023. My research interests lie in the fields of **Causal Inference and Recommender Systems** but I've also dabbled in Robotics and autonomous navigation as a part of Anveshak, the Mars Rover Design Team at IIT Madras.
<br>

I've been fortunate enough to complete some extrremely rewarding internships at Instacart, where I worked on improving the covergae of the sequence recommendation model, and Adobe Research, where I developed a model to counterfactually explain the recommendations provided by a multimodal recommender system. More details about that work [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589335.3651484)!

I worked with [Prof. Leqi Liu](https://leqiliu.github.io/) and [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/) at CMU to develop a unified causal framework for auditing recommender systems: viewing recommender system auditing from a causal lens and provide a general recipe for defining auditing metrics. While at IIT Madras, I worked under [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) and tackled the task of generating diverse natural language counterfactuals for over 11 different Indic Languages. I also interned with [Prof. Rohit Babbar](https://sites.google.com/site/rohitbabbar/Home) at Aalto University and worked on developing deep learning models for Extreme Multilabel Classification.
<br>

Apart from academics, I'm a passionate basketball fan and spend a large chunk of my free time watching games. **#RipCity**
<br>

I also write on occasion: you can find some of my recent ramblings [here](https://www.t5eiitm.org/author/vibhhu-sharma/) and some of my older work [here](https://medium.com/@vibhhusharma2012). I was the Executive Editor at The Fifth Estate, the official campus news body of IIT Madras, where I oversaw a team of 48 people and the daily roll out of content.
