Welcome to my page! 
<br>
I'm an incoming Master's student in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 2023. My research interests lie in the fields of Causal Inference, Recommender Systems and NLP but I've also dabbled in Robotics and autonomous navigation as a part of Anveshak, the Mars Rover Design Team at IIT Madras. 

<br>
I previously interned at Adobe Research and at Aalto University where I worked on generating counterfactual explanations for multimodal recommender systems in the former and on developing deep learning models for Extreme Multilabel Classification in the latter. My Bachelor's thesis  under Prof. Mitesh Khapra tackles the task of generating diverse natural language counterfactuals for over 11 different Indic Languages.

You can find my talk on "Counterfactual Explanations for Visual Recommendation Systems" at WSDM 2023 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4a_rDLrtk)

Apart from academics, I'm a passionate basketball fan and spend a large chunk of my free time watching games. #RipCity

I also write on occasion: you can find some of my recent ramblings [here](https://www.t5eiitm.org/author/vibhhu-sharma/) and some of my older work [here](https://medium.com/@vibhhusharma2012). I was the presiding Executive Editor at The Fifth Estate, the official campus news body of IIT Madras, where I oversaw a team of 48 people and the daily roll out of content.
