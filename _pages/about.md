Welcome to my page! 
<br>
I'm a fourth year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Madras. My research interests lie in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Counterfactuals and Recommender Systems but I've also dabbled in Robotics and autonomous navigation as a part of Anveshak, the Mars Rover Design Team at IIT Madras. I'm currently working under Prof. Mitesh Khapra to generate diverse natural language counterfactuals for over 11 different Indic Languages. 
<br>

Apart from academics, I'm a passionate basketball fan and spend a large chunk of my free time watching games.
<br>

I also write on occasion: you can find some of my recent ramblings [here](https://www.t5eiitm.org/author/vibhhu-sharma/) and some of my older work [here](https://medium.com/@vibhhusharma2012). I am also the presiding Executive Editor at The Fifth Estate, the official campus news body of IIT Madras, and oversee a team of 48 people and the daily roll out of content.
