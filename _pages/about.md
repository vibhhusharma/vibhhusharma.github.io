Welcome to my page! <br>
I'm a third year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Madras. My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Recommender Systems but I've also dabbled in Robotics and autonomous navigation as a part of Anveshak, the Mars Rover Design Team at IIT Madras. I'm currently working as a summer research intern under Prof. Rohit Babbar at Aalto University to attempt to devise new methods of using deep learning for Extreme Multilabel Classification(XMC). More about this field here: <a href="http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html" title="XMC Repository">

Apart from academics, I'm a passionate basketball fan and spend a large chunk of my free time watching games.

I also write on occasion: you can find some of my recent ramblings <a href="https://www.t5eiitm.org/author/vibhhu-sharma/" title="here"> and some of my older work <a href="https://medium.com/@vibhhusharma2012" title="here">
