Welcome to my page! 
<br>

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Thorsten Joachims and Prof. Sarah Dean. My research aims to use machine learning to aid human decision-making in a principled manner that is data-driven, causally motivated, and avoids ethical harm.
<br>

Previously, I've spent some very rewarding time working with wonderful people at [Aven](https://www.aven.com/), Instacart, Adobe Research, Carnegie Mellon University and IIT Madras.
<br>

Apart from academics, I'm a passionate basketball fan and spend a large chunk of my free time watching games. **#RipCity**
